# How the Tests were Found
The method that I used to find the different results was to search through the results manually and compare the results. First, I went into my directory via the terminal and entered `bash script.sh > results-my-implement.txt` into the command line, which would create a separate file containing the results of all 652 tests for my implementation. Next, I went into the directory the implementation provided in lab 9 via the terminal and entered `bash script.sh > results-wk9-implement.txt` into the command line, which would create a separate file containing the results of all 652 tests for the week 9 implementation. Finally, I opened both `.txt` files and compared the results of the `.txt` files as shown below.
