*Brief Note: As expected, since each group's `MarkdownParse.java` file was different, a different format of a test between my Markdown-Parse Repo and the repo being reviewed was required for each code snippet.*

# Snippet 1

The code below illustrates how the actual test for Snippet 1 was conducted in the `MarkdownParseTest.java` file on my Markdown-Parse Repo, where the assert test includes what the test method should've produced per the CommonMark demo site...
